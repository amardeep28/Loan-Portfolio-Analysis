# Loan-Portfolio-Analysis

## Bank Loan Analysis - Financial Data Analytics!

This project, built using Excel, Power BI, and MS SQL Server, dives deep into the intricacies of banking. I've created a comprehensive Bank Loan Report that tackles key challenges in loan monitoring and portfolio performance.

### Key Features:

#### Dynamic Dashboards:
- Track key metrics (loan applications, funded amounts, received amounts, avg. interest rates, debt-to-income ratios) - analyzed month to date and month on month changes.
- Categorize loans into "Good" and "Bad," revealing application percentages and amounts.
#### Actionable Insights:
Analyze monthly trends, regional performance, loan terms, impact of employment length, loan purposes, and home ownership.

### Benefits:

- Data-Driven Decisions: My analysis empowers informed decision-making about lending strategies and portfolio management.
- Improved Monitoring: Track loan performance and identify potential risks with greater efficiency.
